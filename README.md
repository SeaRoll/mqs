# MQS - Simple Message Queue Service

MQS is a lightweight, self-hosted message queue service built with Go. It provides a simple HTTP API for creating topics, publishing messages, and managing webhooks for message delivery.

## Features

*   **Topics**: Create topics to group related messages.
*   **Messages**: Publish JSON-based messages to topics.
*   **Webhooks**: Subscribe to topics with webhooks to receive messages as they are published.
*   **Scalable**: Run multiple message publishers concurrently.
*   **OpenAPI Specification**: A full OpenAPI v3 specification is provided in `openapi.yaml`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
*   [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

### Running with Docker

The easiest way to get MQS up and running is with Docker Compose. A `docker-compose.yml` file is provided for your convenience.

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd mqs
    ```

2.  **Start the services:**

    ```sh
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

This will start the MQS server and a PostgreSQL database. The server will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Configuration

MQS is configured using environment variables:

| Variable      | Description                               | Default |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------|---------|
| `DATABASE_URL`| The connection string for the PostgreSQL database. |         |
| `PORT`        | The port for the HTTP server to listen on.      | `8080`  |
| `LISTEN_POOL` | The number of concurrent message publishers. | `10`    |

## API

The MQS API is documented using the OpenAPI v3 specification. You can find the specification in the `openapi.yaml` file in the root of this repository.

You can use tools like [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) or [Redoc](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc) to view the interactive API documentation.
